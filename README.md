### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone and Install**
   ```bash
   git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
   cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   VITE_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
   VITE_OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=2000
   VITE_OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7
   ```

3. **Get OpenAI API Key**
   - Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Create a new API key
   - Add it to your `.env` file

4. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Configuration Options

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | - | Your OpenAI API key (required) |
| `VITE_OPENAI_MODEL` | `gpt-4o-mini` | OpenAI model to use |
| `VITE_OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS` | `2000` | Maximum tokens per response |
| `VITE_OPENAI_TEMPERATURE` | `0.7` | Response creativity (0-2) |

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React hooks + Context
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API with streaming
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Theme**: next-themes for dark/light mode

### Key Components

- `OpenAIService`: Handles API communication and conversation memory
- `ChatInterface`: Main chat UI with streaming support
- `AIChatInput`: Advanced input with placeholder animations
- `ChatBubble`: Message display with typing indicators
- `ErrorBoundary`: Application-wide error handling

### Production Deployment

1. **Build the application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   Ensure all required environment variables are set in your deployment platform

3. **Security Considerations**
   - API keys are exposed in the browser (for demo purposes)
   - For production, implement a backend proxy to secure API keys
   - Consider rate limiting and user authentication
